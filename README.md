# t-ui 2

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/fAndreuzzi/t-ui2/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/fAndreuzzi/t-ui2/tree/master)

## The goal
I need to rewrite t-ui in order to allow more people to contribute. Actually the code is a mess and I'm the only who can understand what's happening. It's painful to add new features. I hope this refactoring can make t-ui a proper open source project, with a lot of contributors from all over the world. Thank you!

## Can I help you?
Whoever wants to help is welcome! We need a lot of people in order to rewrite t-ui and add a lot of features. Please write me an e-mail if you want to join our Telegram group (a special group for those who are contributing to t-ui2). You can also fix some issues if you want :)

## Technologies
I'll be using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for CI and Git as VCS.

## How to contribute
Create a fork of the repo, and then start working on *develop*.

Branches:
* *master*: I will merge into this one only when we have a working feature in *develop*
* *develop* : Pull requests here

## Test, test, test
One of the biggest errors I made with the first version of t-ui is underconsidering the importance of Unit tests. When you add a new feature, consider adding also some tests to ensure it's working fine. If someone else breaks your code, your test will let us now where is the problem and how to fix it.
